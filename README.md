# About Me
Myself Shreeya Gupta (ECE) from Indore, madhya pradesh. I don't have any particular interest but during the past time I use to code and binge. I even like doing yoga for refreshment.At the end I just want to explore much during this college time, so that I can be the best version of mine.

# Why OS
Open Source is basically a starting point from where I can explore to different coding spheres, further on it gives a professional experience. Open source is damn very essential when we are working in a team over a project.  Contributing to open source projects can even help me to improve my coding skills, learn new technologies, and gain experience while working with others.
